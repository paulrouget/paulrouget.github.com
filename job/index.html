<h1>Paul Rouget</h1>

<p><i>Rust/C/JS. Engineering &amp; Management.</i></p>

<p>I am looking for a job in Taiwan (where I currently reside) or remote.</p>

<p>I'm interested (and have relevant experience) in:
<ul>
  <li>Engineering Management
  <li>Software development
  <li>Developer relations
</ul>
</p>

<p>I write Rust, C and JS code. I have a strong expertise in web technologies: I have worked at Mozilla for 12 years (Firefox &amp; Servo). I also have experience in Embedding &amp; Rust (Nordic and other low-energy CPUs).</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrouget/">LinkedIn here</a> and my <a href="PaulRouget_Resume.pdf">resume (PDF) here</a>.</p>

<p>My email: me@paulrouget.com.</p>

<p>I strongly value work comfort above money. I'm looking for a friendly and human-sized team, reasonable hours and a company with decent values. I have a preference for Desktop applications (native toolkit or web tech) and IoT products, but open to other type of projects.</p>
