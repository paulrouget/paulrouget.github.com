<h1>Mozilla Web Meetup<br>(Toronto, this Friday, ~4pm)</h1>

<p>
You are a web developer and in Toronto this Friday? We need you!
We would like to gather some feedback about our new Firefox Developer Tools. We will use you as our guinea pigs. :) We need feedback, and we  are sure you can get us some terrific ideas of how we can improve our tools.
We might have a little party after the (good) work.
