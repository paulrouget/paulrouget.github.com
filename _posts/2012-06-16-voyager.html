<h1>Voyager 1</h1>

<p>Voyager 1 (the farthest man-made object) left earth 35 years ago. Its current speed is <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/2012-02-10.html">22km/s</a> (80.000km/h). It takes 16 hours to send a message from Voyager to earth, and in the meantime, it will travel 1 million kilometers.</p>

<p>Voyager 1 is apparently entering a zone where the Sun doesn't have much influence anymore. <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-177">"humanity's first emissary to interstellar space is on the edge of our solar system"</a>.</p>

<p>Soon, the interstellar space!</p>
