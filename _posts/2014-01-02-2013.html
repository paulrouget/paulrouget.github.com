  In 2013, I lived in <strong>7</strong> different places, I filed <strong>228</strong> bugs, commented in <strong>578</strong> bugs, fixed <strong>120</strong> of them, and reviewed <strong>165</strong> (landed) patches, I lived in Asia for <strong>2</strong> months, I mentored <strong>13</strong> volunteers (<strong>24</strong> bugs fixed). I shared <strong>373</strong> bugs update on @FirefoxNightly and <a href="http://paulrouget.com/e/byeTwitter/">abandoned my personal twitter account</a> and only blogged <strong>13</strong> times.
