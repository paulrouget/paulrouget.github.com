<p>
  In 2013, I lived in 7 different places, I filed 228 bugs, commented in 578 bugs, fixed 120 of them, and reviewed 165 (landed) patches, I lived in Asia for 2 months, I mentored 13 volunteers (24 bugs fixed). I shared 373 bugs update on @FirefoxNightly and <a href="http://paulrouget.com/e/byeTwitter/">abandoned my personal twitter account</a> and only blogged 13 times.
