<p>Because people keep asking me this question on Twitter <em>"Why is the new Firefox Autralis theme not in Firefox Nightly already?"</em>.
It is not in Firefox Nightly because the code is not ready yet.</p>

<p>It is not in Firefox Nightly (as for today, Oct 9th 2012), and the only thing I can answer to <em>"when will it be
  shipped?"</em> is <em>"when it's ready"</em>. Also, to the people saying <em>"Thunderbird did it already"</em> or
<em>"Addons developers managed to do it, why don't you take their code"</em>, you have to understand that Thunderbird and Addons don't have the same requirements.
Changing such an important part of Firefox UI is not that simple. We need to consider things like Addons compatibility, performance
and OS integration. These things are complex and take time. A lot of time. Even if it sounds easy, it is not.</p>
