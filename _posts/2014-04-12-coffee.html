<h1>Good coffee around the world</h1>

<p>During my various travels, I had a chance to enjoy some very good coffee.
  I like light acidic fruity dripped coffee, and thick acidic espressos. Here
  is a list of the best coffee shops I've been to. I probably missed some
  good places in these cities, so feel free to leave a comment.
</p>

<h2>Paris</h2>

<p>To me, the best coffee shop in town is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafeloustic">Loustic</a>,
  in the 3rd arrondissement. Dripped coffee, espresso and iced coffee are the best.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.telescopecafe.com/">Télescope</a> , in the 1st arrondissement, next to the
  famous "Rue St Anne", is a pretty small place. I highly recommend the espresso there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tenbelles.com/">Ten Belle</a> in the 10th arrondissement is located right next
  to the Canal Saint-Martin. Get a dripped coffee or an espresso, find a bench next to the canal, and
  enjoy your coffee.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coutumecafe.com">Café Coutume</a> , in the 7th arrondissement is a nice place too
  (but way to crowded).</p>

<h2>Berlin</h2>

<p><a href="http://barn.bigcartel.com">The Barn</a> is where I discovered and learned about coffee.
  They now have 2 establishments, the <a href="http://barn.bigcartel.com/coffee-shop">coffee shop</a>
  and the <a href="http://barn.bigcartel.com/the-roastery">roastery</a>. They are both located
  in Mitte. Enjoy their selection of dripped coffee, and their delicious Latte.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiveelephant.com/">5 Elephants</a> is a roastery located in Kreuzberg. Dripped
  coffee is best, and you might want to buy some beans there too.</p>

<h2>London</h2>
<p>I never had a change to really look for good coffee shops in London, but one I really like is
  called <a href="http://newrowcoffee.co.uk/">New Row Coffee</a>, next to Leicester square.</p>

<h2>Toulouse (France)</h2>
<p>Cute place located in the center of the city: <a href="https://fr-fr.facebook.com/cafelafiancee">La Fiancée</a>.
  Try the Siphon coffee, with one of their homemade cookies.</p>

<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.cafeselmagnifico.com/">El Café Magnífico</a> has a very large choice of beans. They will
take the time to brew the beans with the device of your choice, and serve the coffee in large glasses. Try
the espresso (usually, they'll offer you a shot if you buy their beans), but expect something a bit lighter
than what you would find in other places in Europe.</p>

<h2>Portland</h2>
<p>Dripped coffee from <a href="http://www.heartroasters.com/pages/contact">Heart</a> is *really* delicious.
  Reminds me of the coffee at Ten Belle in Paris. They have two shops in town.</p>

<h2>Toronto</h2>
<p><a href="http://senseappeal.ca/">Sense Appeal</a>. Of course! Delicious coffee. Large choice of beans
  and brew methods.</p>

<h2>Taipei (Taiwan)</h2>
<p>Alright. Let me tell you right away: the best coffee I ever had was in Taiwan. Both dripped and espresso.</p>
<p><a href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com/ArtistaPerfetto">Artista Perfetto</a> is a hidden gem located next to SYS memorial hall,
  and, to me, they make the best espresso ever! It fits my taste perfectly, very oily and acidic. Enjoy your cup on the terrasse.</p>
<p>Dripped coffee is science. It's hard to get it right. Extracting the right flavors from the different beans is an art.
  At <a href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com/LaBelleCoffee">La Belle Coffee</a> (used to be "Georges House"), next to Daan park,
  expect a surreal tasting experience. They will spend the time to tell you how to drink their coffee. They will serve the
  same coffee in different type of cups to play with the various way to cool down the coffee. Coffee is delicious,
  and the staff is very very friendly. Highly recommended for an coffee lover.</p>

<h2>Tainan (Taiwan)</h2>
<p>Special mention for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mugongliving">Mugong Living</a>, a guest house in Tainan (south of Taiwan).
  Just drop by, and ask for a coffee. The lovely owner will prepare in front of you some delicious sweet Malaysian coffee with some
  sweet brioche.</p>
