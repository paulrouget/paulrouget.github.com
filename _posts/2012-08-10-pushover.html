<p>I just discovered <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a>. This service does something very simple.
It sends notifications to your phone (Android &amp; iPhone). You can trigger a notification from the HTTP API.</p>
<p>It's pretty simple to send a notification from your shell:</p>
<pre style="padding: 10px;background-color:#EEE">
curl -s \
  -F "token=APP_TOKEN" \
  -F "user=USER_KEY" \
  -F "message=hello world" \
  https://api.pushover.net/1/messages
</pre>
<p>I discovered this app yesterday. So I didn't really have the time to play much with it. But I already use
it to get a notification from Google Calendar (I don't like SMS), from a shell script when I get a specific
email (with a specific topic) and I also send a notification when Firefox finished to compile on my computer (I usually
take a break when I have a long compilation going on, so I'm away from my computer).
<p>Also, <a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt</a> has a channel for Pushover. That opens a lot of possibilities :)</p>
<p>Just wanted to share. Do you know any other app that are in the same "spirit" (I know <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en">tasker</a> too).</p>
