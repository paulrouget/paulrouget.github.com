<h1>@FirefoxNightly twitter account - how you can help</h1>

<p>The goal of the twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/firefoxnightly">FirefoxNightly</a> account
  is to regularly tweet about interesting bug fixes (user facing and web platform features, and performance improvements),
  interesting blog posts or interesting new articles on MDN.</p>

<p>It's not as simple as just "tweeting". Bugs need to be found, tweets need to be scheduled,
  tweets need to be RT by mozillians in their respective timezones,
  bugs need to be validated (is the fixed actually landed in Firefox Nightly, and is it behind
  a pref), tweets need to be redacted (the bug summary is not always enough), maybe a small demo
  or a screenshot would help, tweets need to be synced with our <a href="http://firefoxnightly.tumblr.com/">tumblr blog</a>, ...</p>

<p>This is where I need help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find "things" to tweet about and add them to <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/firefoxnightly">etherpad.mozilla.org/firefoxnightly</a>. This is a thing I'm good at and I'll keep doing it;</li>
  <li>Figuring out how what tool we should use to schedule the tweets and sync them with tumblr (buffer, tweetdeck, IFTTT, ...);</li>
  <li>Make sure tweets get retweeted during the most important timezone;</li>
  <li>Validate the bug and figure out if a pref needs to be switched or not;</li>
  <li>If needed, build a short demo (I use <a href="http://jsbin.com">jsbin.com</a>. If it's a web platform feature, I can do it;</li>
  <li>If needed, take a screenshot (I use <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a>);</li>
  <li>Redact and feed the tweet to twitter.com or to any tool we might use to schedule the tweets</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested to help, please let me know.</p>
