<p>Just thought I'd share that (if you're a Firefox OS hacker, you want to read this).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We recently landed a very basic
timeline in the Firefox DevTools (enable it in the devtools options.
Firefox Nightly required). It is basic. But already useful,
especially to debug Firefox OS apps. For example today, we were
looking at the System App and realized that the main thread was
never idle. Looking at the timeline, we realized that a restyle was
triggered many many times per seconds, even if nothing was happening
on the screen. By tweaking the DOM with the inspector, we figured it
was coming from a CSS animation that was display:none (see <a href="http://bugil.la/962594">bug 962594</a>).
</p>

<p>We are working hard to build new Firefox performance tools. Expect to see better tools coming in the coming
  months. <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.gaia/IT-M42uGT40/_cV31uMY9fcJ">More info about this new timeline tool here</a>.</p>
