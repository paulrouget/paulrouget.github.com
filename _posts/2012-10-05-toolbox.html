<h1>Firefox DevTools: the Toolbox project</h1>

<p>
For the past year, we have landed a lot of developer tools in Firefox.
A JavaScript Debugger, a Style Inspector, a DOM View, a Responsive Design Mode,
a Command Line, â€¦ and more tools are coming.
Think about it, a year ago, we only had the Web Console.
</p>

<p>Well, now we are facing an interesting (but expected) problem: "the DevTools Donut".</p>

<p>The "DevTools Toolbox" will fix this problem. The goal is to gather all the tools into
one single box, and make this box "dockable" (dock it below the page, or on the side, or in
its own window). This work will also introduce a DevTools API into Firefox that addons will
be able to use.</p>

<p>Last week we manage to get the first prototype working. Here are some screenshot and a video
of me demoing the Toolbox to the team (warning: the visual design still needs to be defined):</p>
