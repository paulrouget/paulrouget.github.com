<h1>Mozilla and Github in 2013</h1>

<p>Github shared some interesting data about repositories activity in 2013:
<a href="http://octoverse.github.com/">http://octoverse.github.com/</a>.
And apparently the project with the most merged pull requests is a Mozilla
project: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/">Gaia</a> (Firefox OS frontend),
and the 2nd repository with the most issues closed is also a Mozilla project:
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust">Rust</a> (a programming language).</p>
