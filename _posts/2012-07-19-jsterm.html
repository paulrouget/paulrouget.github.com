<p>JSTerm is an <strong>experimental restartless addon</strong>. It adds a "jsterm" button in the developer Toolbar (Firefox 16+).
The terminal behaves like a shell terminal (history, completion on tab, key bindings, â€¦).
It's a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> environnement.
It uses the builtin Firefox Source Editor to highlight JavaScript. It uses a Sandbox to eval JavaScript. And it comes with an Object Inspector.</p>

<p>For Firefox and Addons developers: like Scratchpad, this tool comes with a <strong>"chrome" mode</strong> (type ":chrome" to enable it).</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> As you know, we already have similar tools in Firefox (Scratchpad and WebConsole). These tools cover some specific
use cases. I'd like to explore alternative ways to cover these use cases (code exploration, prototyping, etc). Scratchpad is still much better
for prototyping. For the REPL environnement, I think this terminal feels more "comfortable" than the Web Console (which comes with REPL + Logging, which limits
the possibilities of the console).</p>

<p>Let me know what you think in the comments (and if you find bugs, please report them on github).</p>
