<h1>Font Inspector in Firefox Nightly</h1>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/robOVAp.png">

<p>I built a font inspector for Firefox. It's now in @FirefoxNightly.
It shows you the font used by the selected element in the page, or
all the fonts used in the page.</p>

<p>The information exposed are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Font name and font family
  <li>its location (system vs. remote, and URL)
  <li>a preview (you can change it)
  <li><code>@font-face</code> code
</ul>

<p>Limitation: I'm focusing on font faces for now.
There's probably more things we can show (colors, font size, line height,â€¦),
but it's not easy to show the font-face info and CSS info simultaneously: we can
have the same font face and several font sizes in the same selected node (a node
can include several nodes, with different styles and different font-faces).
</p>

<p>If you have any idea how to improve this tool, let me know on Twitter (@paulrouget).</p>
