<h1>Paint Flashing in Firefox Nightly</h1>

<p>Yesterday I landed a new feature in the Firefox DevTools: <strong>paint flashing</strong>.
What it does is to highlight areas being painted by Gecko. Avoiding useless painting
operations can help you to build more performant web pages.</p>

<p><strong>Note for Firefox developers:</strong>
The pref <code>nglayout.debug.paint_flashing</code> still works, but I encourage you
to try the <code>paintflashing</code> command:
If you turn on the pref <code>devtools.chrome.enabled</code>,
you can type the command (shift-F2 to bring the command line)
<code>paintflashing on --chrome</code> to enable paint flashing
only for the chrome (the <code>--chrome</code> option is not available
if you don't turn on this pref).
<br>
I introduced a new property to <code>nsIDOMWindowUtils</code>: <code>paintFlashing</code>.
Setting it to true will turn on paint flashing for the specified window, and to false will
clear the colors and stop paint flashing.
