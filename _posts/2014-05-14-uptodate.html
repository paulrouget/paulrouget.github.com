<h1>Tracking what's going on in Firefox Nightly (help needed)</h1>

<p>I'm behind the <a href="http://twitter.com/firefoxnightly">@FirefoxNightly</a> twitter account
(and there's a also a blog: <a href="http://firefoxnightly.tumblr.com/">firefoxnightly.tumblr.com</a>).
I'm supposed to find new features added to Firefox that might impact web developers and end users.</p>

<p>Keeping track of interesting changes without drowning into bugmails is hard. I tried for a long time
to just follow a large set of components, then track the hg commits, but it's just too much work.
I adopted a new strategy, less optimal, but I think it's good enough and doesn't take me too much time:</p>


<h3>bugzilla requests:</h3>
<p>List of bugs that have been fixed and might need my attention:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://is.gd/d06y9h">http://is.gd/d06y9h</a>(flagged as dev-doc-needed)
  <li><a href="http://is.gd/ByEOQG">http://is.gd/ByEOQG</a> (flagged as dev-doc-complete)
  <li><a href="http://is.gd/x2hvnt">http://is.gd/x2hvnt</a> (flagged as feature)</a>
</ul>

<h3>dev.platform: intent to ship/implement</h3>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mozilla.dev.platform">In this mailing list</a>,
I look for the "intent to ship" or "intent to implement" posts.</p>

<h3>Forums:</h3>
<p>I regularly check mozillazine, geckozone and <a href="http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/989780-meet-firefox-next/page-233">neowin threads</a>.
There's a lot of noise there, but there is always one or two users who are very good at spotting new things that I tend to miss.</p>

<h3>Meeting notes:</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/meeting-notes/">blog.mozilla.org/meeting-notes/</a></p>

<h3>@FirefoxNightly mentions:</h3>
<p>Firefox Developers sometimes tweet when a new feature lands, mentionning @FirefoxNightly.</p>

<h2>How you can help:</h2>
<p>If you know any tricks that could help me to find interesting bugs, please let me know. And if
you spot anything that should be tweeted by the @FirefoxNightly account, just tweet and mention @FirefoxNightly.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
