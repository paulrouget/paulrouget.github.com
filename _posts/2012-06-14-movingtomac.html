<h1>s/linux/osx/</h1>

<p>
I am a Linux user. I use <a href="http://paulrouget.com/e/myconf/">Archlinux</a>.
I am now moving to <strong>osx</strong> for a little while. I know I can't stand another OS for too long
(usually, it lasts ~3 months), so I might move back to Linux after the summer.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, first because I like to taste new things. But also because I don't feel "confortable" on
Linux anymore. I very much dislike Gnome 3 for a looooot of reasons (ugly, difficult
to customize, not stable, …). Unity is not better (can't customize, compiz is not stable). The Gnome 2
forks (like cinnamon) are barely working (or you need to use a specific distro like Linux Mint).
I have used Xfce and Lxde for a while… but they are not as good as Gnome 2.</p>
<p>I can't fucking believe that my Linux experience was better 3 years ago… Things go backward.
Well, the Desktop experience. The hardware support is just perfect on my macbook air.</p>
