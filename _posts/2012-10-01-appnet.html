<p class="tldr">I'm still on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/paulrouget">@paulrouget</a>)
and FirefoxNightly as well (<a href="http://twitter.com/firefoxnightly">@FirefoxNightly</a>)
but I can't use Twitter the way I want anymore (<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/09/20/ifttt-twitter/">see this</a>),
so I moved to <a href="http://app.net">App.net</a> (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/paulrouget">@paulrouget</a>).
<strong>All my post there are synced back to Twitter</strong>.</p>

<p>I use Twitter a lot. I use it to promote my own work. To promote Mozilla's work.
To gather feedback. To share the latest gecko updates. To get bug reports. I have
thousand of followers on @paulrouget @firefoxnightly. Twitter is more than a social
network to me. It's a tool. I use it to share and track (aka 'search') things.</p>

<p>But sharing and tracking is getting more and more difficult. I can't use Twitter as
a tool anymore.</p>

<p>For example, I tweet things from the @FirefoxNightly account. And via IFTTT, I could
sync the favorited tweets directly to the Tumblr blog. That is not possible anymore. I
also used to use the "Search Realtime" feature that is not present on mobile anymore or
in the Twitter app (how long before it get removed from the website).
I also used to use the RSS feed. But again, it's gone.</p>

<p>I don't trust Twitter anymore. I will post from App.net now. App.net has been designed
to be instrumentalized. So I can sync it with Twitter (where my followers are), Tumblr,
and it works well with IFTTT.</p>
