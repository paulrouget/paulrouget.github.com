<h1>I'm on <a href="http://alpha.app.net/paulrouget">App.net</a></h1>

<p class="tldr">I'm still on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/paulrouget">@paulrouget</a>)
and FirefoxNightly as well (<a href="http://twitter.com/firefoxnightly">@FirefoxNightly</a>)
but I can't use Twitter the way I want anymore (<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/09/20/ifttt-twitter/">see this</a>),
so I moved to <a href="http://app.net">App.net</a> (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/paulrouget">@paulrouget</a>).
<strong>All my post on App.net are synced back to Twitter</strong>.</p>

<p>I use Twitter a lot. I use it to promote my own work. To promote Mozilla's work.
To gather feedback. To share the latest gecko updates. To get bug reports. I have
thousands of followers on @paulrouget and @firefoxnightly. Twitter is more than a social
network to me. It's a tool. I use it to share and track ('search') things.</p>

<p>But sharing and tracking is getting more and more difficult. I can't use Twitter as
a tool anymore.</p>

<p>For example, I tweet things from the @FirefoxNightly account. And via IFTTT, I could
sync the favorited tweets directly to the <a href="http://firefoxnightly.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a>. That is not possible anymore. I
also used to use the "Search Realtime" feature that is not present on mobile anymore or
in the Twitter app (how long before it gets removed from the website).
I also used to use the RSS feed. But again, it's gone.</p>

<p>I don't trust Twitter anymore. I will post from App.net now. App.net has been designed
to be instrumentalized. So I can sync it with Twitter (where my followers are), Tumblr,
and it works well with IFTTT.</p>

<p>PS: I use <a href="http://twapp.phuu.net/">twapp.phuu.net</a> to sync twitter and app.net. Also, <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> works too (twitter forbids only "read", not "write") but it's not realtime.</p>
