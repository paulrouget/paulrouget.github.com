# s/osx/linux

A little while ago, [I moved from Linux to osx](http://paulrouget.com/e/linux2osx/) because
I was extremely disappointed by the direction Linux Desktop Managers were taking.
I predicted that it would last 3 months before I come back to Linux. It took 5 months.

The **one** thing I love about osx is the compelling user experience. It's solid. Stable.
Smooth. Homogeneous. What I didn't like: It's not custotmizable (all the osx look the same) and it's not
really keyboard-friendly (even though [AlfredApp](http://www.alfredapp.com/) helped a lot).

Jumping from an OS to an other is no big deal. Beside
Firefox, most of the tools I use are text tools (irssi, mutt, vim, …), and they all live in a Tmux (I use
Tmux as a tiling window manager).

## So why do I come back to Linux?

First, I work on Firefox. And I care a lot about Firefox on Linux (performance and frontend). So I want
Linux to be my main OS to make sure I spot bugs early. Let's say I want to do some Linux-specific QA.

Then, I miss Archlinux' [Aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/). *Aur* is Ali Baba's cave for hackers.
*Aur* is a user-contributed repository that contains a **lot** of unexpected/awesome packages.

But my feeling about Linux DM directions hasn't changed. Let me repeat what I said in my
[s/Linux/osx/](http://paulrouget.com/e/linux2osx/) post:
**I can't fucking believe that my Linux experience was better 3 years ago… Things go backward.**

## Update

You can see my XPCE [setup and screenshots here](http://paulrouget.com/e/myconf/).
I spend 90% of my time in Tmux. [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/7FSHx.png).
