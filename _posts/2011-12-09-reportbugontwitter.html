<h1>How to report a Firefox bug on Twitter (to me)</h1>

<p>I have several <a href="http://twitter.com/paulrouget">thousands followers on Twitter</a>. As a Firefox developer,
it's an invaluable way to get inputs from advanced users. I get ideas, I get complains, I get praises, I get bugs.
And believe me, this has a real influence on the quality of Firefox. <strong>Yeah! Thank you all!</strong></p>

<h2>About bug reports…</h2>

<p>I get a lot of them. And often, it is too fuzzy to understand what the problem is.
Let me give you an example:</p>
<blockquote>"Ouch, mediocre rendering of xxx.org/demo.html by Firefox 8 compared to Chrome 17 ! @paulrouget, will this be fixed in Aurora ?"</blockquote>
<p>Everything is wrong in this tweet:
  <ol>
    <li>You don't tell what is actually wrong. I have to open the page, look, and assume that you might be referring to
    this background being stretched. Don't expect me to "guess" what is wrong with your web page. <strong>Tell me precisely what is wrong!</strong>
    <li>There are hundred of lines of code. Do you expect me to go through the whole thing? <strong>Please isolate the bug in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle.net</a>.</strong>
    <li><strong>Don't assume it's a Firefox bug because the result is different from Chrome.</strong> Webkit is not the reference.
    Webkit includes non-standard features. Webkit has bugs, too. Webkit can behave differently because the spec
    has changed. In the case of this tweet, it was a bug in the CSS code of the demo, not in Firefox.
    <li><em>"Will this be fixed in Aurora?"</em> You can test it yourself. <strong>Test with the latest development version of Firefox (<a href="http://firefox.com/nightly">firefox.com/nightly</a>)</strong> to know if it's fixed or not.
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Did you consider opening a bug on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi">bugzilla.mozilla.org?</a>?</h2>

<p>Try to open a bug. It is not that hard. If you're not confident, it's ok. Try to open a bug,
cc me (just type <em>:paul</em> in the CC field), and I will update the bug if there's anything wrong.
I will also make sure that the concerned developer will look at the bug.</p>

<p>You probably want to use these links:
<ul>
  <li>Open a Gecko bug: <a href="http://is.gd/report_gecko_bug_cc_paul">http://is.gd/report_gecko_bug_cc_paul</a>
  <li>Open a Firefox bug: <a href="http://is.gd/report_firefox_bug_cc_paul">http://is.gd/report_firefox_bug_cc_paul</a>
</ul>

<h2>One more thing…</h2>
<p>Being rude doesn't help. That doesn't happen often, but it happens. As someone else said: <q>That question would be easier to answer without the personal attacks</q>.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
