<p>The new curvy tabs design is almost here.
It's available in the Firefox UX branch. You can download it
<a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~jwein/ux-nightly/">here</a>
or wait until it makes it in Firefox Nightly.</p>

<p>From Mike Conley blog post (<a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2013/03/01/australis-curvy-tabs-more-progress/">read it</a>,
it's about the performance of this new design):
<em>"They’re not perfect, not by a long shot, but we’re getting into the polish stage now, which is good"</em>.
