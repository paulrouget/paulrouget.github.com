<h1>Concatenate images with HTML5 Canvas.</h1>

<p>I often need to concatenate images into a single image.
It's a simple operation, but I never found the right tool to
do that. So I made one. It's very simple, read the code, you
might learn some stuff:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In action: <a href="http://paulrouget.com/concatenator">paulrouget.com/concatenator</a>
  <li>Code (just one file): <a href="https://github.com/paulrouget/concatenator">github.com/paulrouget/concatenator</a>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to improve, fix bugs, add optionsâ€¦</p>
