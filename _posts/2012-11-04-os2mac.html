<h1>s/osx/linux</h1>

<p>A little while ago, <a href="http://paulrouget.com/e/linux2osx/">I moved from Linux to osx</a> because
I was extremely disappointed by the direction Linux Desktop Managers were taking.
I predicted that would last 3 months before I come back to Linux. It took 5 months.</p>

<p>The <strong>one</strong> thing I love about osx is the compelling user experience. It's solid. Stable.
Smooth. Homogeneous. What I didn't like: It's not custotmizable (all the osx look the same) and it's not
really keyboard-friendly (even though <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">AlfredApp</a> helped a lot).</p>

<p>Jumping from an OS to an other is no big deal. Beside
Firefox, most of the tools I use are text tools (irssi, mutt, vim, …), and they all live in a Tmux (I use
Tmux as a tiling window manager).</p>

<p>So why do I come back to Linux?</p>

<p>First, I work on Firefox. And I care a lot about Firefox on Linux (performance and frontend). So I want
Linux to be my main OS to make sure I spot bugs early. Let's say I want to do some Linux-specific QA.</p>

<p>Then, I miss Archlinux' <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/"><em>aur/</em></a>. <em>Aur</em> is Ali Baba's cave for hacks.
<em>Aur</em> is a user-contributed repository of packages that contains a <strong>lot</strong> of packages.</p>

<p>Let me repeat what I said in my s/Linux/osx/ post:
<em>I can't fucking believe that my Linux experience was better 3 years ago… Things go backward.</em></p>
