<p>I want a Faenza-based Gaia theme.</p>

<style>
  img {
    float: right;
    margin: 0 10px;
    border: 2px dotted #F06;
    width: 150px;
    padding: 2px;
  }
</style>

<p>Mozilla is building an Mobile OS, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G">B2G</a>.
On top of this OS, we are also building a User Interface,
named <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/gaia">Gaia</a> (<a href="http://joshcarpenter.ca/Boot-to-Gecko">see some mockups</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228?q=gallery%3Atiheum%2F26053633&qo=9">Faenza</a>
is a famous set of icons for Linux. His author, <a href="http://tiheum.deviantart.com/">Tiheum</a> (Matthieu James), has
also built a theme for Gnome (<a href="http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Gnome-Shell-Faience-255097456?q=gallery%3Atiheum%2F26053633&qo=3">Faience</a>),
and made a lot of <a href="http://tiheum.deviantart.com/gallery/">other gorgeous things</a>.

<p>I am a huge fan of <a href="">Tiheum's work</a>. And I believe that a phone UI based
on his work would be a hit. I would love to work on that, but I don't have time. So I am
sharing the idea. It is quite easy to hack Gaia to build a prototype. It is 100%
made of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So if you feel like working on that, please let me know,
I can help you to start :)</p>
