<h1>New Out Of Process Window in Firefox Nightly</h1>
<p>
  In Firefox Nightly (and only in Firefox Nightly), there is new
  menu item called "New OOP window". It opens a new Firefox window
  that load tabs in separate processes (electrolysis).

<p> Bill McCloskey <a href="http://bugzil.la/960783">explains on bugzilla</a>:</p>

  This idea started when we were talking about how to turn electrolysis on
  in nightly. Doing it in the near future would really anger a lot of people
  because basic stuff like printing still doesn't work. However, we do want
  to make it available to more people. A good middle ground would be to add
  a new menu option "New window in separate process" (name could be improved).
  It would be sort of like private browsing mode.
