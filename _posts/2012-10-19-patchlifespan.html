<h1>The average patch “lives” for 3.7 days, which is about the same as the common mosquito.</h1>

<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #ccc">"On average, the lifespan of a pre-rapid release patch is
4.6 days, while the lifespans of post-rapid release patches
are 2.8 days and 3.4 days for core and casual developers
respectively. Therefore, the shortest-lived Firefox patch is a
zero-minute patch submitted before April 2011. The review
request on the patch was made and self-approved and the
actual time delta was 14 seconds. We also calculated the
average lifespan of all the patches in our dataset. The average
patch “lives” for 3.7 days, which is about the same as the
common mosquito."</blockquote>

<p>PS: the lifespan of a patch ends on landing.</p>
