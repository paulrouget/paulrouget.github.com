<p>I’m Paul Rouget. If you were hacking on HTML5 10 years ago, maybe my name will ring a bell.</p>

<p> This is the end of a 17 years long adventure at Mozilla for me. 12 years as an employee after 5 years as a volunteer. Fighting for HTML5. Building Firefox. Creating our first generation of devtools. Managing great teams. Leading products. And finally contributing to Servo, embedding our next generation, rust based, web engine into most platform (Android and the 3 major desktop platforms). Notably, I built and shipped a Servo browser for Microsoft (UWP/ARM AR browser for HoloLens 2) as part of the Mozilla research team. </p>

<p> In 2003/2004, I started contributing the Aviary CVS branch which lead to the creation of Phoenix, then Firebird, up until the day we released Firefox in 2004. With an almost inexistant market share back then. Then came the fight for HTML5 vs XHTML2.  WHATWG vs W3C. </p>

<p> Do you remember this time? </p>

<p> Came the rise of modern web apps, with Chrome along the way. New fight. Which eventually lead me to join the Research Team. Moving from spokesperson (heard of hacks.mozilla.org?), to devtools tech lead, to manager and finally pure research engineer. </p>

<p> Mozilla laid off many people last august. And I’m part of the impacted employees, along all the Servo engineers. No more bugzilla and GitHub morning triage. No more paul@mozilla.com email. No more discussions about how to make things fast, safe, compliant, and user friendly. Almost half of my life to leave behind. </p>

<p> Working with Rust, as part of an amazingly talented team of hackers, I grew as an engineer. </p>

<p> My school was Mozilla. I learnt everything I know there. I met most of my friends there. And Mozilla allowed me to have a meaningful impact on the web, something I’m proud of. </p>

<p> But now the world has changed. The market is different. I don’t know what will be my next battle. Mozilla is now behind me. Let’s see what the future is made of. </p>

<p> There are too many employees and contributors I want to give thanks to. My life would not be the same without their trust and their wise words. </p>

<p> Thank you all. </p>
